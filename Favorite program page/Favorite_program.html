      <h3><b>Know what's inside? Dismantle electronics</b></h3>
      <p>Since I was little, I was interested in knowing what is inside an electronic device, </p>
      <p>my first electronic device that I dismantled was the Playstation 2, because there was a trick to hack and use pirated games at a very low price .</p>
      <p>but I had to modify the reader and buy the chip to be able to install it, after so many tests the ps2 could already run original and pirated games.</p>

      <h3><b>Software hunter!
    In beta or stable phase</b></h3>
      <p>software is very important as hardware. In the last years I have used programs for many kinds of uses and entertainment such as a bookmark organizer as well as software to download music illegally online.
        I remember the first software I installed were games and music players, screen effects in windows such as widgets and so I looked for more software. After searching so much, I learned that the software is classified into two parts: Open Source and paid.
        </p>
      <p>I also had problems downloading unreliable software but fortunately nothing happened and 
I never registered with my real information or credit cards I also knew where the limit is.</p>

      <h3><b>Now as a student! The Python programming language</b></h3>        
      <p>I am very happy that Python was the first language I studied and I am still learning.</p>
      <p>I do not like influencing people about what is wrong or what is good, according to information from many professionals,
           teachers and classmates, the Python language is very simple and very powerful to program.</p>
